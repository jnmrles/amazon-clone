## Reflection 

#### Example:  
This was a week long project where I challenged myself to work with a new stack I wasnt previously familiar with. It was a personal growth test to push myself to build out a popular e-commerce site such as Amazon with React and utilizing the JAMStack with using Firebase cloudfunctions.

I started this process using a create-react-app boilerplate and incorporating state with React Context API.

One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into OAuth, Auth0, and two-factor authentication using Firebase or other third parties. Since I was trying to utilize a serverless stack, I decided to go with Firebase's auth api and later on deployed it on a Firebase Server.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router , React Context, Express, Axios, JSX, Material UI, and CSS.
